            About the Band
            Who We Are
            Rosie Retrospection is an indie band born from late-night jam sessions, secondhand vinyl, and the kind of conversations that linger in your head long after they end. Known for their reflective lyrics, ambient guitar lines, and emotive vocals, the band creates music that feels like a memory you can't quite place — but don't want to forget.
